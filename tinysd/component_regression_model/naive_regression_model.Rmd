## Naive Component Fitting

This is a naive linear regression for all components in the wind turbine dataset

Load the libraries:
``` {r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(purrr)
```

Load the `.csv` file. Read into a standard data frame first, to create proper column names, and then convert into a tibble for use with dplyr and purrr

``` {r}
all_materials <- read.csv("Dataset_wind_turbine_materials.csv")
all_materials <- as_tibble(all_materials)
knitr::kable(head(all_materials))
```
