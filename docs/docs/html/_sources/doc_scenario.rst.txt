Scenario
========

The Scenario class initializes a simulation for a single set of parameters and then executes a user-specified number of uncertainty runs within that scenario.

The DES, Cost Graph, and PyLCIA are all instantiated and called from Scenario, as are postprocessing methods and the diagnostic visualizations.
