Cost Graph
==========

The Cost Graph is a directed network-based representation of the supply chain superstructure. It is used to store information about the supply chain such as costs and distances. During simulation, the Cost Graph is queried by the DES to calculate pathway characteristics and determine the preferred end-of-life pathway for technology components.
