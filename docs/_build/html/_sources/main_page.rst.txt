Welcome to CELAVI's documentation!
==================================

**CELAVI** (pron: c'est la vie) is the Circular Economy Lifecycle Analysis and VIsualization modeling framework. Please visit the [CELAVI](https://github.com/NREL/celavi/) GitHub repository to download the latest release and accompanying datasets.

Please note that when executing CELAVI, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) will throw `A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame` (or `Series`) warnings. This is normal behavior and does not mean that the code is running incorrectly.
